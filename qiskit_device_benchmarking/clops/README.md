# CLOPS Benchmark

This benchmark measures Circuit Layer Operations Per Seconds (CLOPS) of
parameterized utility scale hardware efficient circuits.

CLOPS measures the steady state throughput of a large quantity of these
parameterized circuits that are of width 100 qubits with 100 layers of
gates. Each layer consists of two qubit gates across as many qubits as
possible that can be done in parallel, followed by a single qubit
gate(s) on every qubit to allow any arbitrary rotation, with those
rotations being parameterized.  Parameters are applied to the circuit to
generate a large number of instantiated circuits to be executed on the
quantum computer. It is up to the vendor on how to optimally execute
these circuits for maximal throughput.

CLOPS now supports the new `gen3-turbo` flag for execution path available
on some of our devices.

## Example

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService
from qiskit_device_benchmarking.clops.clops_benchmark import clops_benchmark

service = QiskitRuntimeService(channel="ibm_quantum",
                               instance="your-hub/group/project")

# Run clops with default settings (twirled circuits, 1000 circuits in run,
# 100 wide by 100 layers, etc)  Note this is done in a session and currently
# takes about 10 minutes to run
my_clops_run = clops_benchmark(service, "your-favorite-ibm-quantum-computer")

# To run clops with the new new `gen3-turbo` path, you can specify the
# execution path. For the new faster path you should increase the number
# of circuits to 5,000
my_clops_run = clops_benchmark(service, "machine supporting gen3-turbo", execution_path='gen3-turbo', num_circuits = 5000)

# We can check the attributes of the benchmark run
print(my_clops_run.job_attributes)
{'backend_name': 'ibm_brisbane', 'width': 100, 'layers': 100, 'shots': 100, 'rep_delay': 0.00025, 'num_circuits': 1000, 'circuit_type': 'twirled', 'batch_size': None, 'pipelines': 1}

# There is a standard qiskit job and we can check its status, job_id, etc
print(my_clops_run.job.status())
QUEUED

# The clops method will calculate the clops value for the run
# Note this call will block until the result is ready
print("Measured clops of", my_clops_run.job_attributes['backend_name'], "is", my_clops_run.clops())
Measured clops of ibm_brisbane is 30256

## Variations


The benchmark code provides several ways to measure CLOPS depending on
the capability of the quantum computer.

The "twirling" method uses the native parameterization of the Sampler
primitive to parameterize the circuit, and optimal batching of the
circuits is assumed to be done by the Sampler, freeing the user
from having to optimize the batch size. The only requirement is
that the total number of circuits executed needs to be chosen to
get the system into a steady state to measure CLOPS.

The "parameterized" method is similar, but instead sends an already
parameterized circuit to the Sampler primitive, along with enough
parameters to execute the specified number of circuits. Batching
again is handled by the Sampler. This method requires larger bandwidth
to send in all of the necessary parameters. Currently on IBM systems
you will need to limit the number of circuits to approximately 160 to
fit within API job input limits.

The "instantiated" method (not yet implemented) is for systems that
cannot natively handle parameterized circuits. In this case the circuit
parameters are bound locally and then sent to the quantum computer for
execution.  This method requires the user to specify the desired size of
each batch of circuits (so that they can be sent together the quantum
computer) as well as the number of local parallel pipelines to bind
parameters and create payloads in parallel. The user will need to tune
both of these parameters to try and optimize performance of the
system. This will tend to be much slower than on systems that natively
support parameterized circuits
