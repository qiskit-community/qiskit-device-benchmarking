    The edge grab sampler, given a list of :math:`w` qubits, their connectivity

    as follows:

    1. Begin with the empty set :math:`E` and :math:`E_r`, the set of all edges
    in the connectivity graph. Select an edge from :math:`E_r` at random and
    add it to :math:`E`, removing all edges that share a qubit with the edge
    from :math:`E_r`.

    2. Select edges from :math:`E` with the probability :math:`w\xi/2|E|`. These
    edges will have two-qubit gates in the output layer.

    |

    This produces a layer with an expected two-qubit gate density :math:`\xi`. In the
    default mirror RB configuration where these layers are dressed with single-qubit
    Pauli layers, this means the overall expected two-qubit gate density will be
    :math:`\xi_s/2=\xi`. The actual density will converge to :math:`\xi_s` as the
    circuit size increases.
