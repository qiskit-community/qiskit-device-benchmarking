## Purity RB

Code for running purity RB (notebook [here](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-device-benchmarking/blob/main/notebooks/device_rb.ipynb)). Purity RB appends post rotations
to the RB sequences to calculate Tr(rho^2) as described in the supplement of [arXiv:2302.10881](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10881) and previously in the Ignis code base.
