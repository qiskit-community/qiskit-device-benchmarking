    using purity RB

    # section: overview

    Randomized Benchmarking (RB) is an efficient and robust method
    for estimating the average error rate of a set of quantum gate operations.
    See `Qiskit Textbook
    <https://github.com/Qiskit/textbook/blob/main/notebooks/quantum-hardware/randomized-benchmarking.ipynb>`_
    for an explanation on the RB method.

    A standard RB experiment generates sequences of random Cliffords
    such that the unitary computed by the sequences is the identity.
    After running the sequences on a backend, it calculates the probabilities to get back to
    the ground state, fits an exponentially decaying curve, and estimates
    the Error Per Clifford (EPC), as described in Refs. [1, 2].

    .. note::
        In 0.5.0, the default value of ``optimization_level`` in ``transpile_options`` changed
        from ``0`` to ``1`` for RB experiments. That may result in shorter RB circuits
        hence slower decay curves than before.
